I've created a sleek, user-friendly UI for a news reader that's responsive and looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The design has been saved as "news_reader.html". Here's a breakdown of the key features:

Responsive Design:

The layout uses a grid system that adapts to different screen sizes.
On larger screens, news items are displayed in multiple columns.
On smaller screens (mobile), it switches to a single column layout.
Sleek Appearance:

Clean, modern color scheme with a dark header and light content area.
Subtle shadows and hover effects for depth and interactivity.
Smooth transitions for a polished feel.
User-Friendly Features:

Large, easy-to-read typography.
Clear separation between news items.
"Read more" links for accessing full articles.
Layout:

Header with the title "Sleek News Reader".
News grid displaying article cards.
Each card includes an image, title, brief description, and a link to the full article.
Functionality:

The news items are dynamically generated using JavaScript.
Currently using sample data, but it's set up to easily integrate with an actual news API.
Performance:

Lightweight CSS and JavaScript for fast loading times.
Images are optimized for web (using placeholder images for now).
Flask==2.0.1
Werkzeug==2.0.1
requests==2.31.0
The installation process completed successfully for these packages.

There is a minor conflict noted with yt-dlp, which requires requests>=2.32.2,  installed requests==2.31.0. This shouldn't affect our Flask application
